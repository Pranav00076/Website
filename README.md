## 💻 Local Development

This repository is a static website, so there is no Node install or build step required. The site relies on the Tailwind CDN and Vanilla CSS.

### 1. Environment Setup
To run the website fully (including GitHub stats, Supabase integration, and Firebase Authentication), you need to configure your environment variables. 
Copy the provided `.env.example` or create a new `env.json` and `.env` file in the root directory with your Firebase, Supabase, and GitHub configuration:

```json
{
  "FIREBASE_API_KEY": "YOUR_API_KEY",
  "FIREBASE_AUTH_DOMAIN": "YOUR_AUTH_DOMAIN",
  "FIREBASE_PROJECT_ID": "YOUR_PROJECT_ID",
  "FIREBASE_STORAGE_BUCKET": "YOUR_STORAGE_BUCKET",
  "FIREBASE_MESSAGING_SENDER_ID": "YOUR_MESSAGING_SENDER_ID",
  "FIREBASE_APP_ID": "YOUR_APP_ID",
  "GIT_DEMONDIE_ALL": "YOUR_GITHUB_TOKEN",
  "SUPABASE_URL": "YOUR_SUPABASE_URL",
  "SUPABASE_ANON_KEY": "YOUR_SUPABASE_KEY"
}
```

### 2. Start Local Server
Because the website fetches local JSON and module files, you must serve it over HTTP (opening `index.html` directly in the browser may cause CORS issues).

```bash
# Clone the repo
git clone https://github.com/Demon-Die/Website.git
cd Website

# Start a local web server (e.g. using npx)
npx -y http-server -p 8080
```
Open `http://localhost:8080` in your browser.
